# Description of the work: 
Light-Weight Sequential Sparse Bayesian Learning (LWS-SBL) algorithm is proposed as an alternative to the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm for the general sparse signal recovery problem. Numerical results using the proposed approach demonstrate the superior support recovery performance in different scenarios at a small computational price when compared to the OMP algorithm.
